Xiaonei Conneciton Analysis Extension for Chrome

## Intro

This project is a Chrome extension that visualizes connection network.

The original version is found on [XNAnalysis - Donghao Ren](http://donghaoren.org/projects/xnanalysis). But has lost traces.

An updated version by the original author has been uploaded to a repo on 
github [here](https://github.com/windwish/XNAnalysis2). Improvements implemented here are by no means connected to those
enhancements there and I'm not responsible for whatever update taken place there.

~~Before posting it here, I've been trying to reach the original user but failed nevertheless.~~



## Installation
Create a folder `lnhickcbapflghfffpldgjifgibcemap` under `~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Extensions/` (on Linux) or under corresponding `Extensions` directory on other platforms.
Copy what ever in this repo into that directory.

Restart your Chrome to see the plugin.
